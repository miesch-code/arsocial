## Overview
### Description

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** AR imaging/camera app (marketing, consumer goods, social)
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile, uses camera
- **Story:** Creates AR imaging and a platform to share the images The user can then decide to message this person and befriend them if wanted.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app for image sharing and creation
- **Habit:** This app could be used as frequently or infrequently as the user wanted depending on needs, and what exactly they're looking for before buying a product. Major incentive for businesses to participate in order to make product seem more available
- **Scope:** First we would prompt the user to give AR permissions on the app and to take pictures. Then the user would choose the type of product(s) they want to try and is modelled onto themselves with AR. Then, the user has the option to save the picture in their gallery and share it with others for input.
